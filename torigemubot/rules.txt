Basic rules
-----------------

* Two or more people take turns to play.
* Only nouns are permitted.
* A player who plays a word ending in the mora N (ん) loses the game, as no Japanese word begins with that character.
* Words may not be repeated.
* Phrases connected by no (の) are permitted, but only in those cases where the phrase is sufficiently fossilized to be considered a "word".

Example: sakura (さくら) → rajio (ラジオ) → onigiri (おにぎり) → risu (りす) → sumou (すもう) → udon (うどん)

The player who used the word udon lost this game.

There are various optional and advanced rules, which must be agreed on before the game begins.

Optional rules
-----------------

* Dakuten and handakuten may be ignored or added. Thus suupu (スープ) may be followed by furo (ふろ), and sato (さと) may be followed by dochi (どち).
* A long vowel may either be ignored or considered as a vowel. Mikisaa (ミキサー/みきさあ) can be followed by either sakura (さくら) or aki (あき).
* Common pronouns and place names may be permitted. Example: Edo jou (えどじょう) lit. Edo castle is acceptable.
* Two words spelled with the same kana but different kanji may be permitted. For example, Su (す) can either be spelled as "巣" (lit. a birdnest) or "酢" (lit. vinegar).

Advanced rules
-----------------

* Words are limited to a certain genre.
* Instead of using only the last kana, the final two kana must be used again. In this case, only the first kana may not be the mora N (ん).
* The length of a word must be three or more syllables.
* Only words beginning and ending in dakuten and handakuten may be used.
